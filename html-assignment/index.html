        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Pranav Prasannakumar, hailing from the culturally rich and diverse land of India. My
            journey in the creative realm led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Animation and Graphic Design.</p>

            <p>Throughout my academic voyage, I delved into the intricacies of visual storytelling, animation techniques, and
                graphic design principles. I discovered the power of combining artistic expression with technology to
                create compelling and immersive experiences. This journey not only equipped me with technical skills but also
                nurtured my passion for bringing ideas to life through the lens of visual aesthetics.</p>
